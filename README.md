# Interactive Stage Manager - Device Scripts

This repository contains the .INO files to install onto the devices for the ISM system.
* ism_homebase.ino - Install this script to the device which will act as the "homebase" with the serial connection to a PC. This device will forward commands from the PC to the radio-connected wearable devices. To manage the commands on a PC, use the custom "ISM-Hub" program here: https://github.com/miscapril/ISM-Hub

* ism_wearable - Install this script to the various wearable devices. A random ID is generated, which will not change for an individual device when restarted.
